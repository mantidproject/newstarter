This directory contains the finished exercise of Samuel Jones for both Exercises 1 and 2.

Do not write your code for the exercises in here. Instead, make a copy of the directory containing this file and name your new directory `firstname_surname`. The CMake files contain relative paths so the new directory should be at the same level as the parent `template` directory.
