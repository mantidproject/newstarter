This directory contains the template CMake projects for each of the exercises.

Do not write your code for the exercises in here. Instead, make a copy of the directory containing this file and name your new directory `firstname_surname`. The CMake files contain relative paths so the new directory should be at the same level as the parent `template` directory.
