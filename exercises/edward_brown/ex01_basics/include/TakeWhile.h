/** Builds a substring s of the range [Begin, End) such that s contains

 *  @param Begin The const_iterator marking the begining of the range to be

 *  @param End The const_iterator marking the end of the range to be

 *  @return The a pair (A,B) where A is the substring s, and B is an iterator
 * pointing to to the character which immediately follows s or, End, if the
 * length of s matches the distance between Begin and End.
